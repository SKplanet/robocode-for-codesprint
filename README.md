Robocode for codesprint
===================
This project is forked from [https://github.com/robo-code/robocode](https://github.com/robo-code/robocode/tree/fc1d38dac82022cd4064738d07005306ed695d9f).

This code is used for event [SKplanet code sprint 2015 round 1](http://codesprint.skplanet.com/2015/participation/round/1) to contest better algorithm. We modied some rules of robocode to give participants more fun and to prevent cheating by copying open-sourced robot. The modified rules are following.

* Assumed only 1:1 battle
* Fuel mechanism (A robot consumes fuel when the robot moves and stops when fuel is empty)
* Survival score was modified (A long living robot gets more score)
* *master robot* which has infinite evergy and infinite fuel
* *master robot* algorithm was imported from [Diamond](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Diamond)



Below is the original `README.md`.
